# Feedr Technical Challenge

Have to say this was a fun test!  

Had to update the babelrc file as I was getting an error with my custom hook. [issue](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8829) 

There must be a better way to handle the dietary array than my implementation.

Got the coverage up to 75%.
